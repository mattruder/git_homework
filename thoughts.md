Two takeaways from my time at Turing:
  1) Proper budgeting of time and making flashcards is going to help me get through it.
  2) With the proper knowhow of googling and asking questions, I can accomplish anything in the coding world.

Two new strategies I will try in Mod 0:
  1) Table of contents for my notebook.
  2) Reviewing/making flashcards immediately after each lesson.

Shoutout to Lindsey Lucero for supporting me and suggesting I enroll in this program!
